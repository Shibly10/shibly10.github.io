The research focuses on exploring the potential of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models for domain-specific tasks, particularly within the hotel conversational domain. By constructing a comprehensive dataset from hotel-related conversations, various RAG architectures, such as RAG-end2end, Fusion-in-Decoder (FID) model, are fine-tuned to achieve effective domain adaptation. The study also addresses the critical challenge of reducing hallucinations while maintaining high accuracy in generating domain-relevant responses, an area that has been underexplored in prior work.
