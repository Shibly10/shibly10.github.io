I'm Shibly, a Software Engineer at [Computer Network Systems](https://site.cnsbd.com/) with a passion for continuous learning and growth. I'm highly motivated and always set ambitious goals, working diligently to achieve them. I thrive in collaborative environments and am willing to push beyond my limits to accomplish meaningful work.

As an aspiring researcher, my key interests lie in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Human-Computer Interaction. I enjoy exploring how technology can shape the way humans interact with systems in more intuitive and effective ways.

In my free time, I enjoy playing football and video games, keeping a balanced life between work, study, and recreation.
